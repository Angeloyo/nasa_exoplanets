            The Transit Method
          </h2>

            <p>
              The transit method is the most successful technique for finding exoplanets. It works by detecting 
              the tiny decrease in a star&apos;s brightness when a planet passes in front of it from our point of view.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a planet transits its host star, it blocks a small fraction of the star&apos;s light, creating 
              a characteristic dip in the light curve. By repeatedly observing these transits, scientists can 
              confirm the presence of a planet and determine key properties like its size and orbital period.
            </p>
            <p>
              These brightness dips are extremely small, which is why sensitive space 
              telescopes are needed to detect them.

                Kepler was NASA&apos;s first mission dedicated to finding Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones 
                of distant stars. It stared at a single patch of sky containing over 150,000 stars for nearly 
                four years. The mission discovered over 2,600 confirmed exoplanets and proved that planets are 
                common in our galaxy.

                through multiple observation campaigns. The mission successfully discovered over 500 confirmed 
                exoplanets, extending Kepler&apos;s legacy despite hardware limitations.

              Traditionally, astronomers manually analyzed light curves to identify potential exoplanetsâ€”a 
              time-consuming process given the massive datasets from space missions. Machine learning offers 
              an automated solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              AI models are trained on datasets containing confirmed exoplanets, planetary candidates, and 
              false positives. The models learn to recognize patterns in various features:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
              <li><strong>Orbital Period:</strong> Time it takes for a planet to complete one orbit</li>
              <li><strong>Transit Duration:</strong> How long the planet blocks the star&apos;s light</li>
              <li><strong>Transit Depth:</strong> How much the star&apos;s brightness decreases</li>
              <li><strong>Planetary Radius:</strong> Size of the planet relative to its star</li>
              <li><strong>Stellar Parameters:</strong> Properties of the host star</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              By analyzing these features, machine learning models can quickly classify new observations 
              as confirmed exoplanets, planetary candidates, or false positives with high accuracy. This 
              automation allows scientists to process vast amounts of data and potentially discover planets 
              that might have been missed by manual analysis.

              With missions like TESS generating enormous amounts of data, automated classification becomes 
              essential. Machine learning can:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
              <li>Process thousands of light curves in seconds instead of months</li>
              <li>Identify subtle patterns that might be missed by human analysis</li>
              <li>Consistently apply classification criteria across entire datasets</li>
              <li>Help prioritize targets for follow-up observations</li>
              <li>Discover rare or unusual planetary systems</li>

            <p>
              Our XGBoost model, trained on publicly available data from Kepler, K2, and TESS, demonstrates 
              that machine learning can effectively automate exoplanet detection, helping advance our understanding 
              of planets beyond our solar system.
